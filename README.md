# odin-recipes

I'm writing this after finishing the project, My project was a simple recipe menu that contains several recipes.

Once you click on the recipe, you will see the details of the it.

The details comtain a simple description for the recipe, photo for it, the ingredients ans the steps to make it.

The project was simple and easy, it helped me to develop my skills in HTML like making unordered and ordered lists, using paragraphs, using headings, linking my recipe pages with the index page.
